## üìä API Updates

### New Dependencies
```json
// backend/package.json
{
  "pdfkit": "^0.15.0"  // PDF generation for invoices
}
```

### Updated API Client
```typescript
// frontend/src/lib/api.ts
api.gps.getActiveFleet()
api.gps.getCurrentLocation(bookingId)
api.gps.startSimulation(bookingId, options)

api.invoices.getAll(params)
api.invoices.getById(id)
api.invoices.downloadPDF(id)
```

---

## üß™ Testing

### GPS Simulation Testing
1. Create a booking with origin and destination coordinates
2. Assign a vehicle to the booking
3. Start GPS simulation via admin panel or API
4. Monitor real-time updates on tracking page
5. Check fleet tracking admin page for live vehicle positions

### Customer Portal Testing
1. Register/login as a client
2. Navigate to `/portal`
3. Create bookings
4. Check invoice generation
5. Download invoice PDF
6. Test filters and search

### Chatbot Testing
1. Click chatbot button on any page
2. Test quick reply buttons
3. Type keywords: "pricing", "tracking", "booking"
4. Verify appropriate responses
5. Test on mobile devices

---

## üîê Security Considerations

### GPS Tracking
- Public endpoint for tracking requires valid booking ID
- Admin endpoints protected with JWT
- Rate limiting on GPS endpoints
- Input validation on coordinates

### Customer Portal
- JWT authentication required
- Role-based access control
- Customers can only see their own data
- Admins have full access

### Invoices
- PDF generation is server-side (no client exposure)
- Secure file handling
- Customer data validation
- XSS prevention in PDF content

---

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables
Add to backend `.env`:
```env
# No additional variables required for these features
# Existing JWT_SECRET and MONGODB_URI are sufficient
```

### Database Migrations
Run seed script to create sample data:
```bash
cd backend
npm run seed
```

### Build Process
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm start

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
